  Our primary task is to make sure the Zoo is a happy and functional
  place. To this end, we provide documentation and tips and techniques
  through our <a href="http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/">web server</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to making sure that the machines in the Zoo are
  functioning properly and that you don't have any problems using the
  Zoo facility, we are also involved in the CS Department. Feel free to
  come to us with any concerns or questions that you might have as a CS
  major.
