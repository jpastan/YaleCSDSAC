<body>
<strong> This  is  the  charter  of  the Departmental Student Advisory
	 Committee (DSAC) for the Yale Department of Computer Science.
         Revised March 28, 2018
</strong>

<h1>	 Purposes
</h1>
<ul>
<li>	     To  provide  representation  for  undergraduates  in  the
	 Computer Science Department, that is,  to  provide  a  liason
	 between   the  faculty  and  the  undergraduates  in  matters
	 pertaining to the Computer Science curriculum and the majors'
	 use of departmental resources.

<li>	     To  allocate those resources provided to Computer Science
	 majors and to oversee their use.

<li>	     To act as an advisory board to the faculty  in  cases  of
	 violations  of  system  rules,  and  in other cases requiring
	 disciplinary actions.

<li>	     To act as a forum for the discussion of issues of general
	 interest to users of departmental facilities.
</ul>

<h1>	 Constitution
</h1>
<ul>
<li>	     A committee's tenure will last exactly one academic year.

<li>	     A committee will consist of 5 undergraduates who  satisfy
	 the  DSAC membership requirements as stated below.  They will
	 be chosen via the electoral process outlined below.

<li>	     There  will  be  no  hierarchical  organization  of   the
	 committee.  It will be a democratic body.
</ul>

<h1>	 Elections
</h1>
<ul>
<li>	     General elections are to be held in the spring  of  every
	 academic  year to select those undergraduates who will be the
	 DSAC for the following academic year.  Elections  are  to  be
	 run by one or more non-candidate members of the committee.

<li>	     Elections  will  be  open  to  all  students who meet the
	 membership requirements and will be conducted thus:

<ol>
<li>	        The  names of the candidates will then be made public,
		and they  will  be  invited  to  make  their  campaign
		statements over a period of one week.

<li>	        Voting  will  take place over a one-week period during
		which each voter will be  allowed  to  cast  a  ballot
		naming five candidates of his or her choice.

<li>	        The five candidates with the highest vote counts will
		be the new DSAC.  Any ties will be broken by a run-off
		election.
<li>
							If a candidate wishes to challenge the results, they must email
		dsac@yale.edu within 48 hours of the result announcement.
</ol>

<li>	     Soon after the elections, a meeting will be held for  all
	 departing  and incoming members of DSAC, during which the new
	 members will be initiated to the workings of the committee.

<li>	     If DSAC loses members,  a single spot  may be filled by a
	 unanimous vote  of the other DSAC members.  If more positions
	 need to be filled, a new round of elections must be held.
</ul>



<h1>	 Membership Requirements
</h1>
<ul>
<li>	     Completion of Computer Science 223 or any higher-numbered
course in the major.
</ul>

<h1>	 Amendments
</h1>
<ul>
<li>	     Any part of this document may be amended by the vote of 4
	 or more members.
